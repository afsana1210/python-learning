Our Motivation to Learn the Language:

Learn a language which has minimal complexity

Jumping into for loop and functions asap!

Python removed a lot of pedantic styles in coding and tries to make a guess of what you want.

The boundaries of code is indentation and not curly brackets

Made for non programmers to write code without getting into complexity

Compared to Java it is 1/4 the code but 4 times slow

The soul of the language is to interpret what you wrote and run it rather than being too strict about the coding rules
